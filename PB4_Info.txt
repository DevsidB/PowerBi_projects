prof % = (prof margin/revenue)*100 (the ROI we get for investing certain amount)
prof contr = (prof margin / tot prof margin)*100  (comparison with other products how well our product performed) (the total of all will always be 100 %)

Dax command Note: 
profit margin contribution % = DIVIDE([Total profit margin],CALCULATE([Total profit margin],ALL()))
We can also write :
profit margin contribution % = DIVIDE([Total profit margin],CALCULATE([Total profit margin],ALL('sales markets')))
as we need total profit margin by market, so I think only aggregation by market is sufficient.
